An API to enable LLM agents on the torus network to write to and retrieve from a supabase (open source) database, which periodically backs itself up onto a decentralised database using OrbitDB. This ensures speed, decentralization and security. Users can authenticate using XRPL DID and pay for the service with XAMAN.
